Operating Platforms Course - This course includes a building software design document for a Test Client known as The Gaming Room.  

Below is a brief summary of what I took away from this class and understood. 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Client The Gaming Room had created a game Draw It or Lose it based on an 1980s for android system and was looking to expand their player base into a web browser based game.
The game includes a large library of stock images that would be rendered at a steady rate in which players would attempt to guess in a 30 second timeframe. We were designing the online system 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this project I felt I got a strong understanding of the difference between the Storage, Networks systems and why we choose one operating system over another as well as a graph of concepts and goals of securities, memory managements and operating system architecture. 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found that it was helpful to put down information on paper in a way that could be communicated to others. The business proposal like fashion I think help regular that these choices while technical had to be understood in as much plain language as possible. 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

As a general note, I would have given more specific examples of what I would have done, I felt like too often I spoke in broader terms and didn’t give the exact answers of what and when I needed too. I think this was most apparent in my memory and Security sections. 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I focused much of my documentation on speed in this process, I discussed how I planned to keep load times during gameplay low to non-existent. As the goal from the client was to keep it a simple game, there wasn’t much else to focus on.  
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In the future I would like to focus on expanded features of the game while the client didn't  request it in a real world scenario. I would have suggested this small statistics system for players to discuss over. This will of course require more database thought but I think it’ll make a better overall communal experience.
